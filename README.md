Task 3 challenged us to choose a widely used app and redesign it with a better user experience, clean interface, and improved structure. I selected SBI YONO, the official banking app of the State Bank of India. This app is used by millions daily for UPI payments, balance checks, services, and loan applications â€” but itâ€™s often criticized for being cluttered and outdated.

My redesign focuses on making the app simpler, faster, and more modern for mobile users. I followed consistent spacing, typography, and design system principles while keeping the brandâ€™s core trust intact.

**ðŸŽ¯ Why I Chose SBI YONO**
- Itâ€™s a very popular real-life app (used by me and many others)

- Existing UI is visually dense and outdated

- Navigation is not intuitive, especially for payments

- I saw a clear opportunity to improve the UX, visuals, and flow

**ðŸŽ¨ Design System**
- Typography: Poppins (Regular, Medium)

- Color Palette: SBI Blue #1E3A8A, White, Light Gray, Green for success

- Style: Rounded cards, consistent iconography, shadow and white space

- Interaction: Microanimations like button scale, smooth screen transitions

**ðŸ§­ Prototype**
I created a full clickable prototype using Figmaâ€™s prototype mode. The user can:

- Log in

- Go to Home

- Pay a Contact

- Enter amount and UPI pin

- See the payment confirmation

- Check Transaction History

- All screens are connected logically with smart transitions.
