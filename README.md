**COMPANY**: CODETACH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: JYANI MOHIT

**INTERN ID**:CT08DN821

**DOMAIN**:UI/UX DESIGN

**DURATION**: 8 WEEKS

**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH

For Task 3 of the Codetech UI/UX internship, I chose to redesign the SBI YONO mobile banking app. SBI YONO is one of the most widely used apps in India for digital banking services, but its current user interface feels outdated, crowded, and lacks a modern design flow. My goal with this redesign was to make the app more user-friendly, visually clean, and functionally organized ‚Äî while maintaining the trusted identity of the SBI brand.

**Reason for Choosing SBI YONO**

**I selected SBI YONO because:**

- It is a real, popular mobile app with over 10M+ downloads.

- It has existing UX problems ‚Äî too many buttons, unclear hierarchy, and dated visuals.

- It‚Äôs a perfect opportunity to apply design thinking and show how even large apps can be improved with modern UI/UX principles.

**‚úÖ What I Redesigned**

I redesigned 3 key screens for SBI YONO:

**1. Login Screen**

- Added a welcoming message with the user‚Äôs name for personalization.

- Used a modern blue gradient for branding and a white card layout for login form.

- Included username/password fields with icons, toggleable password visibility, and a clear ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù CTA.

- Added ‚ÄúLogin using MPIN‚Äù and ‚ÄúForgot Password‚Äù links for alternate access options.

- Ensured proper spacing, icon sizing (24px), and mobile-friendly touch areas.

**2. Home Screen (Dashboard)**

- Displayed account balance in a secure, bold card with a show/hide eye icon.

- Organized quick actions (Scan & Pay, YONO Cash, Pay Contact, Request) into a clean horizontal scrollable card layout.

- Presented ‚ÄúSavings & Deposits‚Äù in 3-column cards with icons, names, and amounts.

- Listed recent transactions clearly with name, date, amount, and method (UPI/NEFT).

- Added a unique custom bottom navigation bar with a central floating action button (FAB) for Scan & Pay ‚Äî adding a fresh design twist.

**3. Transaction History Screen**

- Displayed transactions in scrollable cards with avatars, name, date, and amount.

- Used color-coded values: red for debit, green for credit.

- Grouped transactions by date (Today, Yesterday) for better readability.

- Included a ‚ÄúSort By‚Äù dropdown and a ‚ÄúLast 7 Days‚Äù filter dropdown for better control.

- Ensured spacing, font hierarchy, and divider lines were clean and consistent.

**üß† Design System**

- I created a simple, modern design system:

- Colors: SBI Blue (#11438F), White, Light Gray, Accent Green and Red

- Typography: Poppins family (SemiBold for headings, Medium for buttons, Regular for text)

- Buttons: Rounded corners, 16px radius, proper shadow for elevation

- Icon Size: 24px standard, inside 48x48px tap area

- Cards: White with 20px corner radius, clean shadows for depth

**ü™Ñ UX Improvements**

- Simplified navigation and reduced visual clutter.

- Created consistent padding, spacing, and sizing across screens.

- Added a personalized and secure look to increase trust.

- Replaced the outdated icon-heavy home screen with a minimal, organized layout.

- Improved accessibility with color contrast and readable font sizes.
